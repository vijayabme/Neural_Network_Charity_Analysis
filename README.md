# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of the analysis is to predict which applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet soup by analyzing the data from more than 34,000 organizations that received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.

## Results:

#### Data Preprocessing
- The column Is_successful is the target. It has a value of 1 if the applicant was sucessful or 0 if the applicant was not successful.
- The following columns are used as input features for the neural net model
APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
USE_CASE—Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION—Organization type
STATUS—Active status
INCOME_AMT—Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested  
 - The identification columns "EIN" and "NAME" are neither targets nor features.
#### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

####Summary:
